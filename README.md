<p>“AN EYE ON EVE” is an application that helps people actively participate in the programs happening around them by providing details related to the ongoing and planned events in the nearby locations. Basically, this app allows users to know any kind of engaging or volunteering opportunities they do have near them to make their day grateful. Moreover, this app allows another kind of user domain that is organizers. So, using this app event organizers can update their event information which is visible to user. After the event date is over, the events will disappear from the app to maintain consistency and make sure the app is showing valid data.</p>
<p>In this application, we have the following views:</p>
  <p><b>Login view</b>:</p>
<p>Intended to help Users/Organizers to login into the application. User/Organizer can login using their username and password after registering. We can switch between the user and organizer.</p>
  <p><b>Register view</b>:</p>
<p>Intended to collect Users/Organizers details and register them to the application. If the user/organizer didn’t have an account, they can register into the application by enrolling the details.</p>
